<h2> About the CUBE study</h2>
<br>
The CUBE (Covid-19 in the Built Urban Environment) project seeks to develop environmental sampling as a spatially-resolved method for monitoring Covid-19 in congregate settings, such as long-term care homes (LTC), universities, public schools, and daycares. 

We collect samples by swabbing floors; then, the swabs are tested for Covid-19 using an [RT-qPCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction) assay developed by [DNA Genotek](https://www.dnagenotek.com/) and/or a novel CRISPR-based device.

Currently, we are focused on facilities in Toronto, Ottawa, and Sault Ste. Marie.

[Click here to read our preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.21255159v2) from an earlier study showing the effectiveness of environmental sampling for Covid-19 monitoring.

## FAQ

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> Can we tell if the virus is viable or not?</h4>

Our assay is not able to discern whether Covid-19 recovered in floor samples is viable or not. 

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> What can environmental sampling tell us about the Covid-19 burden in congregate settings?</h4>


Detection of Covid-19 in floor samples is correlated with the presence of infected persons.

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> Can I catch Covid-19 from the floor?</h4>

It is highly unlikely for an individual to become infected by Covid-19 from floors, but floors may have some viable virus present.

<br>

<p style='color:white'>
Why do you swab the floors?  
How long will you be swabbing our facilities?  
When will we hear about the results?  
Do we need to clean our floors more often?  
Can you get COVID-19 from the floor?  
Have you found any COVID-19 in our building?  
How long is the study running?  
Who are you working with/who is funding the study?

## Site locations

<br>

This interactive map show sites that are currently being monitored by our research team.

```{r, message=F, warning=FALSE, echo=F}
library(leaflet)
library(tidyverse)
sites <- 
  read_csv(file = 'data/sites.csv') |> 
  mutate(color = case_when(
    type == 'LTC' ~ 'green',
    type == 'Daycare' ~ 'orange',
    type == 'School' ~ 'blue',
    TRUE ~ 'red'
  ))

icons <- awesomeIcons(
  icon = 'cube',
  iconColor = 'white',
  library = 'ion',
  markerColor = sites$color
)

leaflet::leaflet() |>
  setView(
    lng = -80, 
    lat = 44.55, 
    zoom = 6
  )  |> 
  addProviderTiles(
    provider = providers$CartoDB.Positron,
    options = providerTileOptions(minZoom = 6, maxZoom = 10)
  ) |>
  addAwesomeMarkers(
    data = sites,
    lng = ~ lon,
