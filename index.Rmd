    alt="CUBE monitors Covid-19 in congregate settings. We collect samples by swabbing floors. Samples are tested for the presence of Covid-19 RNA using a PCR assay">

The CUBE (Covid-19 in the Built Urban Environment) project seeks to develop and apply environmental sampling as a spatially-resolved method for monitoring Covid-19 in congregate settings including long-term care homes (LTC), universities, and public schools. Currently, we are focused on facilities located in Toronto, Ottawa, and Sault Ste. Marie.

We swab floors and test for Covid-19 using an [RT-qPCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction) assay developed by [DNA Genotek](https://www.dnagenotek.com/) and a novel CRISPR-based device.

## FAQ

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> Can we tell if the virus is viable or not?</h4>

Our assay is not able to discern whether Covid-19 recovered in floor samples is viable or not. 

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> What can environmental sampling tell us about the Covid-19 burden in congregate settings?</h4>


Detection of Covid-19 in floor samples is correlated with the presence of infected persons....
