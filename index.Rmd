<h2> About the CUBE study</h2>
<br>
<!-- blurb -->
The CUBE (Covid-19 in the Built Urban Environment) project seeks to develop environmental sampling as a spatially-resolved method for monitoring Covid-19 in congregate settings such as long-term care homes (LTC), universities, public schools, and daycares. 

We collect samples by swabbing floors; then, the swabs are tested for Covid-19 using an [RT-qPCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction) assay developed by [DNA Genotek](https://www.dnagenotek.com/) and/or a novel CRISPR-based device.

Currently, we are focused on facilities in Toronto, Ottawa, and Sault Ste. Marie.

[Click here to read our preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.21255159v2) from an earlier study showing the effectiveness of environmental sampling for Covid-19 monitoring.

## FAQ

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> Why do you swab the floors?</h4>

We swab floors to pick up any SARS-CoV-2 RNA (the genetic material of the virus) that we can then detect using laboratory-based genetic methods. The aim of our study is to develop this technique as a means to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in congregate settings (eg. schools, daycares, long-term care homes, workplaces, *etc.*).  

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> How long will you be swabbing our facilities?</h4>

Most facilities are swabbed on a weekly basis for a number of months.

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> When will we hear about the results? </h4>

The results will be made publicly available when the study is complete.  

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> Can you get COVID-19 from the floor? Do we need to clean our floors more often? </h4>

The current scientific consensus is that Covid-19 is mainly transmitted through aerosols. It is highly unlikely for an individual to become infected by Covid-19 directly from floors, but floors may have some viable virus present.

<br>


<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> Who are you working with/who is funding the study? </h4>

Our research team has members affliated with The Ottawa Hospital, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Mt. Sinai Hospital, University of Ottawa, Carleton University, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, and DNA Genotek.

<br>

<h4 style="color:DodgerBlue";> Who is funding the study? </h4>

The CUBE study has received funding from NSERC, The Ottawa Hospital Academic Medical Organization (TOHAMO), University of Ottawa, Carleton University, and DNA Genotek.
