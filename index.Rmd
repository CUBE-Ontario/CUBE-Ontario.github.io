## About CUBE

*--infographic here--*

The CUBE (Covid-19 in the Built Urban Environment) project seeks to develop and apply environmental sampling as a spatially-resolved method for monitoring Covid-19 in congregate settings including long-term care homes (LTC), universities, and public schools.

Currently, we are focused on sampling from congregate settings located in Toronto, Ottawa, and Sault Ste. Marie.

## Environmental Swabbing

We swab floors and test for Covid-19 using an [RT-qPCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction) assay developed by [DNA Genotek](https://www.dnagenotek.com/) and a novel CRISPR-based device.
