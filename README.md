# CUBE_website

This is the repository for our public-facing website hosted on github pages: https://cube-ontario.github.io.  

The webpage is rendered from a set of rmarkdown files (*.Rmd), with a yaml file (_site.yml) for the layout and a bootstrap css stylesheet (bootstrap.min.css). The main page is derived from index.Rmd.
