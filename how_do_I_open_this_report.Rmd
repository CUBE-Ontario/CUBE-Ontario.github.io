### "Where do I find the most current password?"

- A new key is generated for each update; old keys won't work. 
- Try searching your inbox for the subject **[CUBE] weekly report - encryption key** and use the **most recent version**. That key will work*.  
- *If it doesn't, then email [Jason Moggridge](mailto:ja.moggridge@gmail.com) for the key and request that your email be added to the mailing list.

### "I can't open the encrypted file..."   
    
<br>
*Try these steps:*   
   
#### 1. Make sure you are in the shared CUBE dropbox folder

- If you are navigating online, the url should be like this:   
    https://www.dropbox.com/home/CUBE%20Study/Data%20Analysis
  
- Otherwise, you probably have the Dropbox app installed on your computer (highly recommended).
  - Ensure that the files are synced to your computer (*ie* sync is not paused). 
  - The report will be in the dropbox folder under `~/Dropbox/CUBE Study/Data Analysis/`   
<br>
    
#### 2. Open the encrypted html file locally, not through dropbox.com
 
<!-- ![]('~/Dropbox/') -->
- Navigate to wherever you have the encrypted html file on your computer (see step 1). 
- Open the encrypted html file and enter the key. 
- This will prompt you to save a new (decrypted) html file. Do so. 
- Open the decrypted file that you just saved. It will work*.
- *If issues persist, first ensure that you are indeed using the most recent key, then email [Jason Moggridge](mailto:ja.moggridge@gmail.com). Please try to provide any information about where the issue is occurring.
